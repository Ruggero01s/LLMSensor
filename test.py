Specifically: * The IP address 192.168.231.56 makes repeated DNS requests to the internal IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost), which is refusing to perform recursive queries. \n * The same IP address also makes requests for PTR records (75.231.168.192.in-addr.arpa and 56.231.168.192.in-addr.arpa) that are forwarded to an external DNS server (8.8.8.8). * The response from the internal nameserver (127.0.0.1) includes a domain name (smtp.davey.russellmitchell.com), which suggests that the DNS server is being used as a proxy for a legitimate-looking but potentially malicious communication. These patterns are indicative of a possible DNS tunneling or exfiltration attempt, where an attacker uses a DNS query to send or receive data. Further investigation and analysis may be necessary to confirm the malicious activity."}'
