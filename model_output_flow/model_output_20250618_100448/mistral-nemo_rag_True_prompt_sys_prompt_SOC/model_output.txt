{'malicious': 'True', 'reason': 'High number of connections with low packet rate (Flows 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), repeated connections from the same IP (Flows 4 and 8 have the same Source IP but different Destination IPs), long flows with very low data transfer (Flow 2 has high Duration but low Total Packets), frequent resets or SYN-only flows (Flow 6 has high SYN Flag Count), unbalanced down/up ratios (Flow 10 has Down/Up Ratio of 9.48 which is unusually high). These patterns suggest a potential Network Denial of Service attack.'}
